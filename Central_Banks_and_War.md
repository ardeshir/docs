### A quote from economist Richard Werner:
 **“Central banking and warfare are very closely linked,” highlighting his perspective on the connection between monetary authorities and military conflict.**

Richard Werner, well-known for his research and public explanations on banking and monetary systems, has argued in multiple interviews and writings that central banks often play a crucial role in enabling and sustaining warfare. His core contention is that the power to create money—by central banks and large private banks—allows governments to finance wars beyond what would otherwise be possible solely through taxation or direct public consent[1][2][3].

### Werner's Key Points on Central Banking and Warfare

- **Financing Wars**: Werner points out that major wars—such as the World Wars—were only possible because central banks could create credit to finance massive government expenditures. Historical examples include the Bank of England's founding to finance war with France and the Federal Reserve's role in funding both World Wars[1][4].
- **Lack of Oversight and Consequences**: Central banks' ability to expand or contract credit—especially during war—has wide-reaching effects. This credit creation can lead to asset bubbles, recessions, and even fund covert operations, according to Werner[1][5].
- **Historical Perspective**: Academic research backs the idea that sovereigns with central banks have lower borrowing costs during wartime and can more easily raise funds for military campaigns, reinforcing the tight relationship between banking and armed conflict[6][7].
- **Expansion of Central Bank Power**: Werner claims that crises and conflicts often prompt authorities to grant even more power to central banks, which can result in consolidation and centralization of financial control[3].

### Supporting Academic and Media References

- Several studies and articles, including those published by Cambridge University Press and Forbes, have corroborated that central banks were often founded or given enhanced powers specifically to meet the financial challenges of warfare, making their connection to military conflict historically “intimate.”[6][4]
- Media and independent journalistic interviews with Werner (e.g., with Tucker Carlson in 2025) discuss these topics explicitly, with Werner describing how central banking institutions have enabled government military expenditure, financial instability, and sometimes, covert geopolitical maneuvers[1][8].
- Broader research also explains the operational details: in wartime, central banks help governments borrow at lower costs, step in to buy government debt, and manage domestic and foreign reserves tied directly to military needs[9][10].

**Summary:** 
Richard Werner consistently argues, both in interviews and academic contexts, that central banking is intertwined with warfare by providing governments the means to finance large-scale conflicts—often without public scrutiny. This view is substantiated by academic research and historical precedent, illustrating how the power to create money translates into geopolitical and military power[1][6][4].
