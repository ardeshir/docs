#Q: Can you explain the science and technology that allowed for very long distance transmission of digital information, from satellites and telecommunication towers?  How are the frequencies for different providers kept separate across countries and companies?  

#A:  Long-distance transmission of digital information involves several technologies and scientific concepts. At the root of this are electromagnetic waves, which can carry information over vast distances. These waves are used in everything from radio to TV broadcasts, mobile phone signals, and satellite communications.

###Satellite Communication: Satellites are used to transmit data over long distances. They receive signals (data) sent from an earth station and retransmit them back to different locations on earth. The data can be TV broadcasts, internet data, or voice calls. The signals are sent as electromagnetic waves, typically in the microwave part of the spectrum, which can pass through the atmosphere.
Telecommunication Towers: These towers send and receive signals to and from mobile devices. They use antennas to send signals in specific directions. The data is sent over electromagnetic waves, usually in the radio frequency part of the spectrum.
Fibre Optic Technology: This technology uses light signals to transmit data over long distances. The light is sent down thin strands of glass or plastic, known as optical fibers. The light signals can carry vast amounts of data and are immune to electromagnetic interference, making them ideal for long-distance data transmission.

###As for keeping the frequencies separate, this is managed by international and national regulatory bodies. For example, in the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates who can use which frequencies and for what purpose. They divide the spectrum into bands and allocate them to different services. This prevents interference between different services and providers.

###Internationally, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum, promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, and improves communication infrastructure in the developing world.
