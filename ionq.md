# IonQ


Analysis of IonQ’s quantum computing prospects and whether it’s worth adding to a portfolio:

## **The Real Deal on IonQ’s Quantum Technology**

**✅ Legitimate Technology & Progress:**
IonQ’s CEO projects going from 50 to 100 qubits next year through to a million qubits in 2030, with their next generation chip having 64 algorithmic qubits equivalent to 1 billion GPUs to simulate . The Oxford Ionics acquisition brings together complementary trapped-ion quantum computing technologies, with Oxford Ionics holding world records for quantum fidelity  .

**Strong Momentum:**

- Stock jumped 33% week-over-week after UK regulatory approval, hitting new 52-week highs around $58  
- Demonstrated 20x speed-up in quantum-accelerated drug development with AstraZeneca, AWS, and NVIDIA 
- Beat Q2 revenue guidance by 15% and secured $1B equity investment 

## **Financial Reality Check**

**Revenue Growth but Major Losses:**

- 2025 revenue guidance: $82-100M (vs $43.1M in 2024)  
- Q2 operating loss of $160.6M on just $20.7M revenue, with $181.3M in operating expenses 
- With $1.6B cash but quarterly losses of $177M, company has less than 9 quarters of runway without significant revenue increases 

## **Investment Verdict: High Risk, High Reward**

**🔴 Reasons to be Cautious:**

1. **Extreme Valuation**: P/S ratio of 170 is astronomically high 
1. **Cash Burn**: Heavy losses with limited path to profitability in near term
1. **Early Market**: Quantum computing is still years from mainstream commercial viability
1. **Execution Risk**: Multiple complex acquisitions to integrate

**🟢 Reasons to Consider:**

1. **Market Leadership**: One of the few pure-play public quantum companies
1. **Strategic Acquisitions**: Building comprehensive quantum + networking ecosystem
1. **Strong Partnerships**: Government contracts, major tech collaborations
1. **Technical Progress**: Real demonstrations showing quantum advantages

## **My Take**

This is a legitimate quantum computing company making real technical progress, but it’s **extremely speculative**. Boston Consulting Group projects $850 billion in global quantum value by 2040 , so the market opportunity is massive if they execute successfully.

**Portfolio Recommendation**: Only suitable for **high-risk growth investors** willing to allocate 1-3% of portfolio to emerging tech moonshots. The recent 33% surge means you’re buying at peak valuations. Consider waiting for a pullback or dollar-cost averaging over time.

The quantum computer is “for real,” but whether IonQ becomes profitable and justifies current valuations remains to be seen.
