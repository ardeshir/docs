## Core Philosophy & Research Framework

Pi represents a distinctive intellectual position in AI research—one that bridges **computer science, evolutionary biology, physics, neuroscience, and philosophy**. Their work is organized around five interconnected paradigm shifts:

### 1. Natural Computing

The radical premise that **computing existed in nature long before artificial computers**. Drawing on John von Neumann’s insight that DNA functions like a Turing tape, and Wheeler’s “it from bit” hypothesis, Pi argues that life itself is inherently computational. Their landmark “Computational Substrates” paper demonstrated self-replicating programs emerging spontaneously from “primordial soups” of random code —a digital analog to abiogenesis.

### 2. Neural Computing

Current AI infrastructure remains hobbled by classical sequential computing paradigms. Pi advocates for truly brain-like architectures with massively parallel processing and data locality , arguing that GPUs/TPUs are only stepping stones toward genuinely neural silicon.

### 3. Predictive Intelligence

The success of LLMs reveals something fundamental: intelligence is statistical modeling of the future (including one’s own future actions) given a growing body of knowledge, observations, and feedback from the past . This aligns with the “predictive brain hypothesis” in neuroscience.

### 4. General Intelligence

Pi takes the controversial position that “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI) may already be here — we just keep shifting the goalposts . They argue that individual humans are now *less* general than AI models in terms of breadth of capability.

### 5. Collective Intelligence

Intelligence is fundamentally **social and modular**—from cortical columns to human societies. This frames AI development as potentially multi-agent and socially organized rather than monolithic.

## Key Research Outputs

### Artificial Life & Origins Research

Their **cubff** repository (159 stars) implements the “Computational Life” experiments showing how self-replicators emerge from random Brainfuck code without any explicit fitness function—just dynamic stability through self-modification . This work has been published in Physical Review and covered widely (New Scientist, Popular Science, Sean Carroll’s Mindscape podcast).

### Project Suncatcher

A “moonshot” initiative to scale machine-learning compute in space using solar-powered satellite constellations carrying Google TPUs . Two prototype satellites are planned for launch with Planet Labs in early 2027. The rationale: space offers up to 8x more productive solar energy and eliminates terrestrial resource constraints.

### Multi-Agent Learning

Papers on “learning-aware policy gradients” and “Embedded Universal Predictive Intelligence” explore how cooperation emerges when agents learn to model each other—connecting evolutionary symbiosis to AI alignment.

### AI Ethics & Consciousness

The team includes philosophers (Geoff Keeling, Winnie Street) working on questions like AI moral patiency, the attribution of confidence to LLMs, and whether AI can make trade-offs involving “stipulated pain and pleasure states.”

## The Book: “What Is Intelligence?” (September 2025)

Blaise Agüera y Arcas’s 600-page book, published by MIT Press/Antikythera, serves as the manifesto for Pi’s worldview. It argues that prediction is fundamental not only to intelligence and the brain but to life itself . The book was included in the Financial Times’s Best Books of 2025 and praised by figures including Patricia Churchland, Terrence Sejnowski, and David Krakauer (President of Santa Fe Institute).

## Position in the AI Research Landscape

Pi occupies a **unique intellectual niche** compared to other major AI labs:

|Aspect                     |Pi’s Position                                |Contrast with Others                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|**Fundamental orientation**|Bottom-up, evolutionary                      |OpenAI/Anthropic: Engineering-focused scaling|
|**View of AGI**            |Already here, continuously emerging          |Others: Future threshold to cross            |
|**Key metaphor**           |Life/symbiosis/ecology                       |Others: Engineering/optimization             |
|**Safety framing**         |Through understanding collective intelligence|Others: Alignment/control problems           |
|**Disciplinary roots**     |Physics, biology, philosophy                 |Others: Primarily ML/engineering             |
|**Infrastructure vision**  |Space-based, neural computing                |Others: Terrestrial scaling                  |

Pi represents a **“naturalist” school of AI thinking**—viewing artificial intelligence not as something fundamentally separate from biological intelligence, but as a continuation of the same computational processes that gave rise to life itself. This contrasts with both the “AI as engineering artifact” view and the “AI as existential risk” framing.

## Team Composition

The team is notably **interdisciplinary**, including:

- **ML researchers**: João Sacramento, Alexander Meulemans, Seijin Kobayashi, Nino Scherrer
- **Philosophers/ethicists**: Geoff Keeling, Winnie Street
- **Physicists/complexity scientists**: Thomas Fischbacher, Rif A. Saurous
- **Visual/generative researchers**: Alexander Mordvintsev (of Neural CA fame), Eyvind Niklasson
- **Infrastructure**: Travis Beals (leading Project Suncatcher)

## Significance

Pi represents perhaps the most philosophically ambitious AI research program inside a major tech company—one that treats the question “What is intelligence?” not as a branding exercise but as a genuine scientific and metaphysical inquiry requiring interdisciplinary synthesis. Their work suggests that understanding AI requires understanding life, evolution, and consciousness as interconnected computational phenomena.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## 🧠 What Paradigms of Intelligence Really Is

Paradigms of Intelligence (Pi) is a research team at Google focused on foundational, long-term, interdisciplinary research into the nature and evolution of intelligence — both natural and artificial. Their work is not a typical product unit, but a research organization aiming to rethink core assumptions in AI and cognition.  ￼

The group:
	- •	Is led by Blaise Agüera y Arcas, a well-known Google VP of Research with a long history of foundational work in machine learning, perception, and computational theory.  ￼
	- •	Combines philosophers, engineers, and scientists to explore what intelligence truly is, how it emerges, and how it might be built fundamentally differently from mainstream deep learning approaches.  ￼
	- •	Publishes across disciplines — from Nature and Communications of the ACM to ArXiv and physical sciences journals — signaling broad, collaborative scholarship.  ￼

Mission statement: advance understanding of how intelligence evolves to benefit humanity and sentient life.  ￼

⸻

## 🔬 Core Research Themes and Paradigms

The team’s research agenda is structured around several interrelated paradigms — each challenging dominant AI assumptions:

📌 1. Natural Computing
	- •	Intelligence and complex behavior aren’t exclusive to silicon computers — they precede them in biology.
	- •	The goal is a theoretical framework linking evolution, complexity, and computation.  ￼

🧠 2. Neural Computing
	- •	Argues that current AI processors (GPUs, TPUs) are fundamentally constrained by classical computing paradigms.
	- •	Emphasizes massively parallel, brain-like architectures with data locality as a new substrate for future systems.  ￼

🌐 3. Predictive Intelligence
	- •	Intelligence is described as ongoing statistical modeling of the future based on past observations.
	- •	Blurs traditional boundaries between training and deployment, hinting at continuously learning and interactive systems.  ￼

👥 4. Collective Intelligence
	- •	Intelligence is not just an isolated system — social and multi-agent dynamics may be core to scaling cognition.
	- •	Suggests research in cooperative behaviors, modularity, and mutual modeling as paths to more capable intelligence.  ￼

⸻

## 📚 Publications and Output

The Pi team has a significant scholarly footprint across venues:
	- •	Peer-reviewed journals in AI, ethics, philosophy, and physical sciences.
	- •	Preprints on ArXiv that explore learning structures, representation geometry, multi-agent systems, and cellular automata.
	- •	Interdisciplinary pieces bridging biology, computation, and philosophical foundations of cognition.  ￼

## 🧠 Intellectual Orientation

Pi’s perspective on intelligence is distinct from many mainstream AI labs:

⚙️ Bottom-up and interdisciplinary: Intelligence is seen as a natural phenomenon evolved over billions of years — not a narrow engineering artifact.  ￼
🧬 Biology-inspired: Natural systems are viewed as powerful analogues — understanding life as computation guides new frameworks.  ￼
🔄 Continuous learning over static training: Intelligence should grow and adapt continuously, not just through discrete training runs.  ￼
🤝 Collective & social scaling: Cognition is modular and social, not solitary.  ￼

This contrasts with the industry’s current scaling-centric view, which focuses heavily on larger models and more data. Pi’s focus is on principle, architecture, and evolution rather than scale alone.

⸻

## 🤝 Where Pi Fits in the Broader AI Research Landscape

While Pi is Google-sponsored and uniquely positioned to pursue long-term foundational questions, its research aligns with broader shifts in AI research:
	- •	Other communities are exploring alternative paradigms (e.g., neuro-symbolic blends, algorithm discovery, agent-based learning).  ￼
	- •	Philosophers and cognitive scientists are integrating findings from AI to rethink cognition and intelligence.
	- •	A growing emphasis on ethics, alignment, and societal impacts — topics reflected in Pi’s work — is influencing public and scholarly discourse.

In short, Pi’s work is part of a larger move away from “more parameters = more intelligence” toward richer architectural understanding and biologically grounded cognition.
