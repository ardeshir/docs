#### Corollating the Second Law of thermodynamics with Freezing temperatures as it would affect electric sytems?
Certainly, it's an interesting task to relate the Second Law of Thermodynamics to freezing temperatures and their potential impacts on electrical systems. 

The Second Law of Thermodynamics essentially states that the entropy of any isolated system always increases. Entropy is a measure of the amount of disorder or randomness in a system.

This can be linked to freezing temperatures in the following way: As temperatures go down, thermal energy within any system also decreases. This reduced thermal energy typically results in lower molecular motion, implying lower entropy.

As for electrical systems, extremely low temperatures, such as freezing point and below can introduce several effects:

1. Resistance Changes: Many electrical components, such as resistors, have temperature-dependent properties. For instance, metallic conductors usually have resistance that increases with decreasing temperature.

2. Material Property Alteration: Freezing temperatures can also change the material properties. For example, some materials become superconductors at very low temperatures leading to zero electrical resistance.

3. Battery Performance Issues: Cold temperatures severely affect battery performance due to slower chemical reactions within the battery, which can reduce its output and efficiency.

Note, an electrical system in practice is not an isolated system. However, the general principle of the Second Law, that is systems tend towards disorder, manifests in real-world inefficiencies and energy loss like heat dissipation in electrical systems too.
