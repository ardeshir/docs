#### Can you summarize the importance of Dartmouth College hosting the Summer Research Project on AI conference, where Prof. McCarthy defined artificial intelligence in 1955 as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”?

#### A:
The Dartmouth Conference in the summer of 1955 is often credited as the birthplace of artificial intelligence as a field of study. This event was significant because it brought together many leading researchers of the time, including Prof. John McCarthy, who did indeed define AI as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines". These researchers proposed that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be described so precisely that a machine can be made to simulate it.

The conference initiated the formalization of AI research and is where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined, paving the way for the development of AI technologies that we see today. It also affirmed that AI has the potential to be a dynamic game-changer, influencing various sectors such as healthcare, finance, IT, among others.

The Dartmouth Conference remains an important historical event in AI, not only for its role in introducing AI as a formal field of study but also for setting up the roadmap for its future development.
