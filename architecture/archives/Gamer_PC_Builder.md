When building a PC, it is important to consider your budget and what games you want to play. You will also need to decide on the form factor of your case (ATX, mATX, or ITX) and how much cooling you will need. Once you have a good idea of what you need, you can start shopping for parts.

Here are some other things to keep in mind when building a PC:

Make sure all of your parts are compatible with each other.
Don't forget to factor in the cost of extras like a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and operating system.
Be patient and take your time. Building a PC can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it is important to do it right.
