# Cold War history: September 11, 1973 

A military coup in Chile that overthrew democratically elected socialist president Salvador Allende.

## Historical Context and Analysis

The Chilean coup represents one of the most well-documented cases of US covert intervention during the Cold War. Key facts include:

**The Event**: On September 11, 1973, Chilean military forces led by General Augusto Pinochet surrounded the presidential palace (La Moneda). Allende died during the coup, and Pinochet established a military dictatorship that lasted until 1990.

**US Involvement**: Declassified documents have confirmed extensive CIA operations to destabilize Allende’s government, including:

- Economic warfare and funding of opposition groups
- Support for strikes and political unrest
- Attempts to prevent Allende’s initial election in 1970
- The “Track II” program aimed at encouraging a military coup

## Place in US Foreign Intervention History

This coup fits into a broader pattern of US Cold War interventions in Latin America, including:

- Guatemala (1954)
- Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba (1961)
- Dominican Republic (1965)
- Nicaragua (1980s)

The Chilean intervention is particularly significant because it involved overthrowing a democratically elected government, which contradicted stated US values of supporting democracy. The subsequent Pinochet regime’s human rights abuses (thousands killed and “disappeared”) later became a source of controversy regarding the long-term consequences of such interventions.

This event remains a key reference point in discussions about US foreign policy, sovereignty, and the tension between geopolitical interests and democratic principles.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
