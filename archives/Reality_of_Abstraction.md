# Reality of Abstraction

It is a most important paradox that to “advance” we must grasp the fundamental principles of the most primitive form of biochemical evolution and Thermodynamics! 

An interesting loop, for Nature to understand itself (via a human’s mind) it constantly reinvents itself at higher & higher levels of “consciousness”, which we represent as “abstractions” when we communicate scientifically, thus the most fundamental reality becomes the most abstract, when explaining it to itself.

The smartest biological system in the world 🌎 is not the human brain, but Mycelium connected to trillions of other mycelial systems in the formation of massive Forest 🌳 Soils around the planet.  Mother Nature’s Mind is the most efficient HR, human resource manager!  😉

Humans of late ⏰, internet 🛜  trolls, think they’re the largest network but we’re not even close.

I think when Human networks begin to match the levels of Mycelial programming, then our networks will be “smart enough” to save us from ourselves.
