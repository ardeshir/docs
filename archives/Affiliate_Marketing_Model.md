#### What is the main purpose of Affiliate Marketing business model? 

The main purpose of the Affiliate Marketing business model is to generate revenue through the promotion of a company's products or services. In this model, an affiliate partners with a company to endorse or advertise their offerings, often through a unique affiliate link on their own websites, blogs, or social media channels. When customers make a purchase using the affiliate's link, the affiliate earns a commission from the company. This model is a performance-based approach to marketing, as affiliates are only paid when their promotional efforts result in a transaction. 

One of the key benefits of affiliate marketing is that it allows companies to tap into diverse markets and audiences through the reach and influence of their affiliates, thus extending their reach without the need for extensive marketing efforts.
