# Technology Revolutions & Financial Capital

Carlota Perez’s “Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital” presents a compelling cyclical theory of technological change that has become influential in innovation studies, economic history, and technology policy. Her work deserves both appreciation for its synthetic power and critical scrutiny for its deterministic tendencies.

## Core Theoretical Framework

Perez argues that technological progress occurs through discrete “revolutions” - clusters of radical innovations that fundamentally reshape the economy and society. Each revolution follows a predictable two-phase, 50-60 year cycle:

**Installation Period (20-30 years):**

- New technologies emerge and face resistance from existing institutions
- Financial capital leads, seeking high returns from emerging technologies
- Creates speculative bubbles as markets overheat
- Ends in financial crisis/collapse

**Deployment Period (20-30 years):**

- Post-crisis regulation and institutional adaptation
- Production capital takes the lead
- Broad diffusion of technologies throughout the economy
- “Golden Age” of widespread prosperity and productivity growth

She identifies five complete revolutions: Industrial Revolution (1771), Age of Steam and Railways (1829), Age of Steel and Electricity (1875), Age of Oil and Mass Production (1908), and the Information Age (1971).

## Strengths and Empirical Support

Perez’s framework demonstrates remarkable explanatory power for several historical patterns:

**Financial Cycles:** Her model accurately captures the boom-bust patterns associated with major technological shifts - from railway mania in the 1840s to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The prediction that financial crisis would follow the IT bubble proved prescient with the 2008 financial crisis.

**Institutional Co-evolution:** Her insight that technologies require complementary institutional changes is well-supported. The assembly line needed new labor relations; the internet required new regulatory frameworks and business models.

**Geographical Shifts:** Her observation that technological leadership migrates between nations aligns with historical evidence - from Britain’s early industrial dominance to America’s 20th-century technological leadership.

## Critical Challenges and Theoretical Limitations

### Deterministic Oversimplification

Perez’s neat cyclical model imposes artificial periodization on messy historical reality. Technological change is far more continuous and overlapping than her discrete “revolutions” suggest. The boundaries between her revolutions are often arbitrary - why separate steel/electricity from oil/mass production when they were deeply intertwined?

### Financial Capital vs. Production Capital Dichotomy

This binary framework oversimplifies modern financial systems. Contemporary venture capital, private equity, and corporate R&D blur the lines between “financial” and “production” capital. Tech giants like Google and Apple are simultaneously production companies and massive financial actors.

### Technological Determinism

Despite claims otherwise, Perez’s framework is fundamentally technologically deterministic. Social, political, and cultural factors appear mainly as responses to technological imperatives rather than as co-determining forces. This understates human agency in shaping technological trajectories.

## Wealth Creation and Inequality: A Critical Assessment

### Problematic Assumptions About “Golden Ages”

Perez’s concept of post-crisis “Golden Ages” characterized by broad prosperity is historically questionable:

**The Gilded Age Reality:** Her “Age of Steel and Electricity” deployment phase (1890s-1920s) coincided with extreme inequality, labor strife, and the robber baron era - hardly a golden age for most workers.

**Mid-20th Century Exception:** The post-WWII “Golden Age” she associates with mass production was largely a product of specific historical circumstances - world war destruction, strong labor movements, and deliberate government policy - not inevitable technological deployment.

**Contemporary Divergence:** Since the 1970s IT revolution, we’ve seen increasing inequality and wage stagnation despite massive productivity gains, contradicting her prediction of broad prosperity during deployment phases.

### Inadequate Treatment of Power Relations

Perez’s framework largely ignores how technological revolutions alter power relationships and who captures the benefits:

**Network Effects and Monopolization:** Digital technologies create winner-take-all dynamics that concentrate wealth in ways her theory doesn’t anticipate.

**Labor Displacement:** She underestimates how each revolution can permanently displace certain types of workers, creating structural unemployment and inequality.

**Financialization:** Rather than retreating after installation periods, financial capital has become increasingly dominant throughout the economy, extracting value rather than creating it.

## Contemporary Relevance and Limitations

### Climate Change and Sustainability

Perez’s framework struggles with environmental constraints that didn’t bind earlier revolutions. The climate crisis requires rapid decoupling of growth from resource consumption - a challenge her growth-oriented model doesn’t adequately address.

### Global South and Uneven Development

Her Eurocentric framework largely ignores how technological revolutions have reinforced global inequalities. Each revolution has often strengthened core-periphery relationships rather than creating universal prosperity.

### Platform Capitalism

Contemporary digital platforms represent a fundamentally different form of capitalism than her industrial model assumes. The extraction of data value, network effects, and platform monopolization require theoretical frameworks beyond her cyclical model.

## Conclusion: Valuable but Incomplete

Perez’s work remains valuable for understanding broad patterns of technological and economic change. Her insight that technologies require complementary institutional changes is crucial for policy makers and business strategists. However, her framework’s deterministic tendencies, oversimplified financial dynamics, and inadequate treatment of power relations limit its explanatory power.

Most critically, her assumption that technological deployment automatically leads to broad prosperity has been thoroughly refuted by recent decades. The challenge for contemporary policy is precisely to ensure that technological progress serves broad social welfare rather than concentrating benefits among techno-financial elites.

Her work is best understood as a useful heuristic for thinking about long-term technological change rather than a predictive theory. It provides a framework for asking important questions about institutional adaptation and technological diffusion, but practitioners must supplement it with more nuanced understanding of politics, power, and distributional conflict in shaping technological outcomes.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
