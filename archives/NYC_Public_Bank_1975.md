# NYC Public Bank Failure - 1975

⸻

🔎 The article (“New York City’s Forgotten Public Bank Plan”) recounts a moment in 1975, when the political leadership of New York City and the New York State Assembly considered creating a public bank — both at the state level (a state-owned bank) and a municipal bank for NYC.  ￼
	•	The push came after what the article calls a “credit strike”: private banks and Wall Street refused to underwrite or roll over NYC’s short-term notes / debt — essentially freezing the city out of its normal financing routes. That refusal was a central trigger for the city’s 1975 fiscal crisis.  ￼
	•	The proposed public bank would have had broad powers: hold deposits, make loans, underwrite municipal bonds/notes — effectively replacing much of the city’s reliance on private banks. With roughly US$ 3 billion in state deposits sitting in private banks, a state bank would have instantly become one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  ￼
	•	Support for this plan was not trivial: major institutions such as the largest municipal union (District Council 37, AFSCME) backed it; even consumer-rights activist Ralph Nader testified in favor; and the president of the only existing fully state-owned U.S. bank (Bank of North Dakota — the only U.S. state bank at the time) endorsed it.  ￼
	•	But powerful financial-industry opposition mobilized quickly. Headlines warned of an “encroachment on the free-enterprise system.”  ￼  A confidential industry memo (later leaked/published) noted the competitive threat: a public bank would enjoy structural advantages (public deposits, favorable tax treatment) and could offer credit on terms private banks couldn’t match.  ￼
	•	In the end, the bill passed the Assembly but died in the Republican-controlled State Senate.  ￼
	•	What followed was not just a bailout or austerity — but a reordering of political and financial power. Government finances became subordinate to the logic of financial markets; public borrowing, investment, and spending were constrained by what private lenders would allow.  ￼
	•	The consequences were deep and long-lasting: public services cut, hiring freezes/layoffs, tuition imposed on what was previously free tuition at the City University of New York, deterioration of public transit, reductions in schools, parks, public health, etc.  ￼

So the “public-bank moment” for New York was real — and was scuttled not by technical infeasibility, but by political/economic interests and power.

🧮 Theoretical Possibilities: What a Public Bank Could Do (and What Proponents Claim)

The article argues a public bank isn’t just nostalgic — it remains a practical, implementable alternative. Here’s what could be theoretically possible:
	•	A public bank could hold the city’s — or state’s — deposits, rather than placing them in private/commercial banks. That means instead of paying fees and interest to Wall Street banks, public funds stay in public control.  ￼
	•	It could offer loans for public-purpose projects: affordable housing, community development, infrastructure (transit, climate-resilient infrastructure), worker-cooperatives, small businesses, community land trusts, etc.  ￼
	•	Because a public bank is not profit-driven in the same way, the logic of decision-making could shift: from “maximize returns” to “maximize public benefit.” That opens room for investments (e.g. in low-income housing, climate resilience, underserved neighborhoods) that private banks might reject as too risky or unprofitable.  ￼
	•	It could also help rebuild financial infrastructure, especially in underbanked or “banking-desert” neighborhoods, improving financial inclusion by partnering with community credit unions or other local institutions.  ￼
	•	More broadly: a public bank can function as a foundational part of “municipal socialism” — enabling governance over land, housing, work, transit, finance — introducing a structural shift in who controls capital.  ￼

In short: a public bank offers sovereignty, control, and alignment — financial tools aligned to public/social goals rather than extraction/profit.

🧭 Why the Idea Matters Now (2025) — Why the Old “Moment” Is Back on the Table
	•	The article points out that after decades of financialization, disinvestment, austerity, and reliance on private finance, many communities in NYC are facing deep crises: housing unaffordability, climate vulnerability, austerity pressures, inequality.  ￼
	•	The election of Zohran Mamdani — who supports public banking and had previously cosponsored legislation (the New York Public Banking Act) to enable municipal public banks — means the political conditions may have shifted.  ￼
	•	A coalition of community groups, labor unions, housing/climate organizers, credit unions, worker cooperatives — that was largely missing in the 1970s — now exists and could supply the mass base and grassroots pressure needed to push such a structural change.  ￼
	•	Importantly: public banking is no longer purely theoretical. There are real, existing institutions that echo some of its functions (e.g. community development credit unions, community lending).  ￼
	•	Thus, the question is no longer just whether public banking is “possible in theory,” but whether the political moment will push through the unfinished work of creating a public bank that can handle public deposits, make loans, and act at scale.  ￼

⚠️ Challenges & What’s Not Guaranteed — Why It’s “Theoretical,” Not a Sure Thing

As the article itself notes, public banks are not inherently virtuous — their outcomes depend heavily on governance, purpose, and oversight.  ￼

Some of the main challenges or caveats:
	•	A public bank could be captured by elite or political interests, reproducing inequalities or inefficiencies instead of dismantling them, if governance is weak or co-opted.  ￼
	•	Political opposition remains fierce: as seen in the 1970s, private banking and finance interests have structural advantages, and likely will resist any shift that threatens profits.  ￼
	•	Even if legally allowed (via the Public Banking Act), building a full-scale public bank — with capacity to hold deposits, underwrite large projects, make loans, manage risk — is a major institutional undertaking. It would require not just legislation but governance frameworks, staffing, risk controls, transparency mechanisms, public oversight. Not trivial.
	•	The necessary scale matters: to have real impact (e.g. on housing, climate infrastructure, community investing), the bank needs large capital — perhaps requiring sustained public support, plus contributions from community financial institutions.

⸻

🧑‍🏫 Broader Historical & Theoretical Reference — Where Else This Has (or Hasn’t) Been Tried
	•	The article points to the example of Bank of North Dakota (BND) — the only existing fully state-owned bank in the U.S. — as evidence that public banking can work at scale.  ￼
	•	Historically, the failure to establish a public bank in NYC helped set the pattern: after the 1975–76 fiscal crisis, the city accepted a new financial governance order: austerity, market dominance, subordinated public investment — shaping urban policy for decades.  ￼
	•	In more recent years, “public banking” has returned as a policy proposal in many cities/states — in part inspired by the growing crises of housing affordability, climate change, inequality, and disinvestment, and by growing community-led alternatives (co-ops, community land trusts, credit unions).  ￼
	•	The theoretical logic is that public banks (or public-finance institutions) serve like public infrastructure — like roads, transit systems, water systems — but for money and credit. They embed the distribution of financial resources in public — or collectively governed — hands, rather than private profit-driven ones. That transforms how capital flows and what projects are prioritized.  ￼

✅ Conclusion: What’s “Possible” — if Effort Aligns with Political Will

The article makes a compelling case that:
	•	The failure to create a public bank in 1975–76 was not because the idea was impractical or unworkable — but because entrenched financial power mobilized against it.  ￼
	•	With the election of a mayor supportive of public banking (and a broader coalition including community groups, unions, co-ops, credit unions), now may be the first time in decades that a serious, large-scale public-bank proposal has a realistic shot in a major U.S. city.  ￼
	•	If established — with democratic governance, public mandates, transparency — a public bank could reshape finance: enable massive investments in affordable housing, infrastructure, climate resilience; channel credit into underserved communities; democratize access to capital; reduce reliance on private finance and debt intermediaries; treat public money as public infrastructure.  ￼

In other words: what’s being described is less a radical fantasy than a structural alternative — a reimagining of how money, credit, and public purpose could be organized.

Below is a global map of large-scale public banks and public-finance institutions, including what worked, what failed, and why. This should give you a solid structural understanding of what’s possible — and what pitfalls NYC (or any public-bank project) would face.

I’ve grouped them into:
	1.	Fully state-owned development banks
	2.	Municipal / subnational public banks
	3.	Sector-specific public finance institutions
	4.	Historic failures (why they failed)
	5.	Key design principles that separate successes from disasters

	•	Later faced NPA (non-performing asset) crises due to political lending
Lesson:
Strong governance + independent credit evaluation is essential.

⸻

⚠️ 5. HISTORICAL FAILURES — AND WHY THEY FAILED

❌ Public banks used to plug budget gaps
	•	Puerto Rico’s GDB
	•	Various Latin American national banks (1960s–1980s)
They collapsed because they became political ATMs, not banks.

❌ Public banks without independent credit oversight
	•	Some Indian PSBs in the 1990s–2000s
	•	Parts of Brazil’s BNDES during corruption scandals
Lesson: Professional credit committees must be insulated from politicians.

❌ Overly centralized mega-banks with no local governance
	•	Some Chinese local government financing vehicles (LGFVs)
Lesson: scale isn’t everything — you also need democratic/transparent guardrails.

🧩 6. WHAT MAKES PUBLIC BANKS SUCCEED

Across countries and decades, the successful models share five design principles:

(1) Clear public mandate

Not all-purpose — always mission-driven
(e.g. housing, climate, SMEs, infrastructure).

(2) Independent, professional governance

KfW, EIB, Sparkassen = textbook examples.

(3) Insulation from electoral politics

Credit decisions made by bankers, not politicians.

(4) Risk diversification + conservative underwriting

Most successful public banks are extremely risk-averse.

(5) Partnership model

Work with community lenders, don’t compete against them
(e.g. KfW–Sparkassen, BND–local credit unions).

⸻

🧭 7. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR NYC

Historically and globally, the key insight is this:

Public banks succeed when they are mission-driven, technocratically run, and democratically accountable — not when they’re used as political piggybanks.

NYC could build one of the most powerful public finance institutions in the world if it follows the successful models (KfW, EIB, Sparkassen) and avoids the political-patronage failures.

A truly well-designed NYC Public Bank could theoretically:
	•	Hold billions in city/state deposits
	•	Fund affordable housing, CLTs, co-ops
	•	Finance green infrastructure and transit
	•	Support community lenders
	•	Reduce reliance on Wall Street underwriting
	•	Act countercyclically in downturns
	•	Drive long-term local economic development

In global historical terms, this is absolutely possible — it’s been done many times and often at far larger scale.
