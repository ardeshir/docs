# NYC Public Bank Failure - 1975

⸻

🔎 What the article describes — the 1970s moment and its failure
	•	The article (“New York City’s Forgotten Public Bank Plan”) recounts a moment in 1975, when the political leadership of New York City and the New York State Assembly considered creating a public bank — both at the state level (a state-owned bank) and a municipal bank for NYC.  ￼
	•	The push came after what the article calls a “credit strike”: private banks and Wall Street refused to underwrite or roll over NYC’s short-term notes / debt — essentially freezing the city out of its normal financing routes. That refusal was a central trigger for the city’s 1975 fiscal crisis.  ￼
	•	The proposed public bank would have had broad powers: hold deposits, make loans, underwrite municipal bonds/notes — effectively replacing much of the city’s reliance on private banks. With roughly US$ 3 billion in state deposits sitting in private banks, a state bank would have instantly become one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  ￼
	•	Support for this plan was not trivial: major institutions such as the largest municipal union (District Council 37, AFSCME) backed it; even consumer-rights activist Ralph Nader testified in favor; and the president of the only existing fully state-owned U.S. bank (Bank of North Dakota — the only U.S. state bank at the time) endorsed it.  ￼
	•	But powerful financial-industry opposition mobilized quickly. Headlines warned of an “encroachment on the free-enterprise system.”  ￼  A confidential industry memo (later leaked/published) noted the competitive threat: a public bank would enjoy structural advantages (public deposits, favorable tax treatment) and could offer credit on terms private banks couldn’t match.  ￼
	•	In the end, the bill passed the Assembly but died in the Republican-controlled State Senate.  ￼
	•	What followed was not just a bailout or austerity — but a reordering of political and financial power. Government finances became subordinate to the logic of financial markets; public borrowing, investment, and spending were constrained by what private lenders would allow.  ￼
	•	The consequences were deep and long-lasting: public services cut, hiring freezes/layoffs, tuition imposed on what was previously free tuition at the City University of New York, deterioration of public transit, reductions in schools, parks, public health, etc.  ￼

So the “public-bank moment” for New York was real — and was scuttled not by technical infeasibility, but by political/economic interests and power.

🧮 Theoretical Possibilities: What a Public Bank Could Do (and What Proponents Claim)

The article argues a public bank isn’t just nostalgic — it remains a practical, implementable alternative. Here’s what could be theoretically possible:
	•	A public bank could hold the city’s — or state’s — deposits, rather than placing them in private/commercial banks. That means instead of paying fees and interest to Wall Street banks, public funds stay in public control.  ￼
	•	It could offer loans for public-purpose projects: affordable housing, community development, infrastructure (transit, climate-resilient infrastructure), worker-cooperatives, small businesses, community land trusts, etc.  ￼
	•	Because a public bank is not profit-driven in the same way, the logic of decision-making could shift: from “maximize returns” to “maximize public benefit.” That opens room for investments (e.g. in low-income housing, climate resilience, underserved neighborhoods) that private banks might reject as too risky or unprofitable.  ￼
	•	It could also help rebuild financial infrastructure, especially in underbanked or “banking-desert” neighborhoods, improving financial inclusion by partnering with community credit unions or other local institutions.  ￼
	•	More broadly: a public bank can function as a foundational part of “municipal socialism” — enabling governance over land, housing, work, transit, finance — introducing a structural shift in who controls capital.  ￼

In short: a public bank offers sovereignty, control, and alignment — financial tools aligned to public/social goals rather than extraction/profit.

🧭 Why the Idea Matters Now (2025) — Why the Old “Moment” Is Back on the Table
	•	The article points out that after decades of financialization, disinvestment, austerity, and reliance on private finance, many communities in NYC are facing deep crises: housing unaffordability, climate vulnerability, austerity pressures, inequality.  ￼
	•	The election of Zohran Mamdani — who supports public banking and had previously cosponsored legislation (the New York Public Banking Act) to enable municipal public banks — means the political conditions may have shifted.  ￼
	•	A coalition of community groups, labor unions, housing/climate organizers, credit unions, worker cooperatives — that was largely missing in the 1970s — now exists and could supply the mass base and grassroots pressure needed to push such a structural change.  ￼
	•	Importantly: public banking is no longer purely theoretical. There are real, existing institutions that echo some of its functions (e.g. community development credit unions, community lending).  ￼
	•	Thus, the question is no longer just whether public banking is “possible in theory,” but whether the political moment will push through the unfinished work of creating a public bank that can handle public deposits, make loans, and act at scale.  ￼

⚠️ Challenges & What’s Not Guaranteed — Why It’s “Theoretical,” Not a Sure Thing

As the article itself notes, public banks are not inherently virtuous — their outcomes depend heavily on governance, purpose, and oversight.  ￼

Some of the main challenges or caveats:
	•	A public bank could be captured by elite or political interests, reproducing inequalities or inefficiencies instead of dismantling them, if governance is weak or co-opted.  ￼
	•	Political opposition remains fierce: as seen in the 1970s, private banking and finance interests have structural advantages, and likely will resist any shift that threatens profits.  ￼
	•	Even if legally allowed (via the Public Banking Act), building a full-scale public bank — with capacity to hold deposits, underwrite large projects, make loans, manage risk — is a major institutional undertaking. It would require not just legislation but governance frameworks, staffing, risk controls, transparency mechanisms, public oversight. Not trivial.
	•	The necessary scale matters: to have real impact (e.g. on housing, climate infrastructure, community investing), the bank needs large capital — perhaps requiring sustained public support, plus contributions from community financial institutions.

🧑‍🏫 Broader Historical & Theoretical Reference — Where Else This Has (or Hasn’t) Been Tried
	•	The article points to the example of Bank of North Dakota (BND) — the only existing fully state-owned bank in the U.S. — as evidence that public banking can work at scale.  ￼
	•	Historically, the failure to establish a public bank in NYC helped set the pattern: after the 1975–76 fiscal crisis, the city accepted a new financial governance order: austerity, market dominance, subordinated public investment — shaping urban policy for decades.  ￼
	•	In more recent years, “public banking” has returned as a policy proposal in many cities/states — in part inspired by the growing crises of housing affordability, climate change, inequality, and disinvestment, and by growing community-led alternatives (co-ops, community land trusts, credit unions).  ￼
	•	The theoretical logic is that public banks (or public-finance institutions) serve like public infrastructure — like roads, transit systems, water systems — but for money and credit. They embed the distribution of financial resources in public — or collectively governed — hands, rather than private profit-driven ones. That transforms how capital flows and what projects are prioritized.  ￼

✅ Conclusion: What’s “Possible” — if Effort Aligns with Political Will

The article makes a compelling case that:
	•	The failure to create a public bank in 1975–76 was not because the idea was impractical or unworkable — but because entrenched financial power mobilized against it.  ￼
	•	With the election of a mayor supportive of public banking (and a broader coalition including community groups, unions, co-ops, credit unions), now may be the first time in decades that a serious, large-scale public-bank proposal has a realistic shot in a major U.S. city.  ￼
	•	If established — with democratic governance, public mandates, transparency — a public bank could reshape finance: enable massive investments in affordable housing, infrastructure, climate resilience; channel credit into underserved communities; democratize access to capital; reduce reliance on private finance and debt intermediaries; treat public money as public infrastructure.  ￼

In other words: what’s being described is less a radical fantasy than a structural alternative — a reimagining of how money, credit, and public purpose could be organized.
