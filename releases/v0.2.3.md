> **Released:** December 27, 2024
> **Codename:** Stage2
> **Milestone:** Full Self-Hosting Verified
> **Year 1 Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Overview

DOL v0.2.3 "Stage2" proves the self-hosting compiler works end-to-end. The compiler
compiled from DOL sources (Stage2) can successfully:

- Parse DOL files
- Generate Rust code from DOL
- Bootstrap the entire toolchain

This validates that DOL is a complete, self-sustaining programming language.

## Key Achievement: Stage2 Self-Hosting Test

| Phase | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Phase 0 | Complete | 1532 tests pass (target: 1300+) |
| Phase 1 | Complete | MISMATCH_TABLE.md documents all differences |
| Phase 2 | Complete | Fixed codegen issues |
| Phase 3-4 | Complete | Updated parser and codegen |
| Phase 5 | Complete | Stage2 compiles with 0 errors (578 warnings) |
| Phase 6 | Complete | Self-hosting works! |

**Result:** Stage2 compiler is fully functional.
