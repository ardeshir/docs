# DOL v0.6.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 2025
**Codename:** Gene Inheritance

---

## Overview

DOL v0.6.0 focuses on WASM compilation improvements, specifically implementing gene inheritance for WebAssembly targets.

---

## New Features

### Gene Inheritance for WASM Compilation

The WASM compiler now fully supports gene inheritance hierarchies:

```dol
gene Animal {
    has name: String
    has age: Int32
}

gene Dog extends Animal {
    has breed: String
}
```

When compiled to WASM, inheritance relationships are properly preserved with:
- Field composition from parent genes
- Method resolution following inheritance chains
- Type compatibility for polymorphic operations

---

## Changes

### WASM Backend

- Implemented gene inheritance in WASM compilation (`feature/gene-wasm` PR #3)
- Updated test plan with gene inheritance status
- Fixed edge cases in inherited field handling

---

# From crates.io
