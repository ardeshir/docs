# DOL v0.2.2 "Bootstrap"

> **Released:** December 2025
> **Codename:** Bootstrap
> **Milestone:** Self-Hosting Complete
> **Year 1 Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Overview

DOL v0.2.2 marks the completion of Year 1 "Genesis" with a fully working
self-hosting compiler. The DOL compiler can now compile its own source code
to valid Rust.

This release represents the culmination of a year's work:
- Q1: Turing Extensions (v0.1.x)
- Q2: Meta-Programming (v0.2.0)
- Q3: MLIR/MCP Server (v0.2.1)
- Q4: Self-Hosting Bootstrap (v0.2.2)

---

## Key Achievement: Self-Hosting

The following DOL source files now compile to valid Rust:

- `ast.dol` - Abstract Syntax Tree definitions
- `token.dol` - Lexer token types
- `bootstrap.dol` - Compiler bootstrap logic

**Result:** 2544 lines of generated Rust, 0 compilation errors.

---

## Installation

```bash
cargo install dol
```

Or add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
dol = "0.2.2"
```

- Macro invocation syntax (`println!()`)

### Test Suite
- 741+ tests passing (up from 590 in v0.2.0)
- Bootstrap verification tests
- Generated code compilation tests
