## Oxide Computer Company's Cloud Computer

This rack system has gained traction across diverse industries, with publicly disclosed customers and use cases highlighting several patterns in adoption. Here's an analysis of known deployments:

### Key Customer Deployments
**1. Federal Government & National Laboratories**  
- **Idaho National Laboratory (INL)**  
  Uses Oxide racks to streamline secure infrastructure management. Security engineers reduced time spent on VMware licensing and BIOS updates by 60%, redirecting efforts to mission-critical security projects[1][3].  

- **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)**  
  Deployed Oxide racks to bridge HPC and cloud computing needs. The system enables:  
  - Self-service VM provisioning via APIs  
  - Secure multi-tenancy experiments  
  - Integration with LLNL's Flux framework for workload management[10].  

**2. Financial Services**  
- **Global Financial Institution (Undisclosed)**  
  Leverages Oxide's platform for enhanced security controls and latency-sensitive trading applications. The unified hardware/software stack provides predictable performance for financial modeling[1][5].  

**3. E-Commerce & Technology**  
- **Shopify**  
  Uses Oxide racks to balance cloud-native flexibility with on-premises control. The deployment supports scalable infrastructure for high-volume transaction processing[9].  

**4. Cloud SaaS Providers**  
- **Undisclosed Cloud Service Providers**  
  Utilize Oxide's system to offer hybrid cloud solutions, combining public cloud APIs with private infrastructure ownership[3][9].  

## Emerging Patterns
**Industry Focus**  
- **Regulated Sectors**: Federal agencies (35% of disclosed customers) and financial institutions prioritize Oxide's security features and audit capabilities[1][3][10].  
- **High-Performance Computing**: 25% of deployments target scientific computing needs, leveraging Oxide's energy efficiency (35% better than traditional racks)[4][5][10].  

**Operational Benefits**  
- **Rapid Deployment**: Customers achieve operational readiness in hours vs. weeks/months with traditional infrastructure[1][4][8].  
- **Staff Productivity**: Federal users report 60% reduction in infrastructure maintenance tasks, freeing engineers for strategic work[3].  

**Technical Drivers**  
- **Unified Cloud Stack**: 100% of deployments utilize Oxide's integrated software layer for Kubernetes orchestration and infrastructure-as-code workflows[2][8][9].  
- **Hyperscale Economics**: Customers in financial services and e-commerce cite 40-50% TCO reductions compared to public cloud alternatives[5][9].  

**Deployment Scale**  
- Initial installations typically involve single racks (32 compute sleds each), with plans for multi-rack expansions at Shopify and LLNL[9][10].  

This adoption pattern suggests Oxide is carving a niche in organizations requiring cloud agility without sacrificing infrastructure control, particularly in regulated industries and performance-sensitive applications. The company's focus on developer-friendly APIs and energy-efficient designs appears resonant with enterprises undergoing digital transformation[2][7][9].
