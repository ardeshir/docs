# The Problem with Growth

It’s important to define our problem clearly, and attack its core, to expose its weaknesses.

Trump’s Administration is literally using the 3rd world empire playbook, that historically has been used against everyone else, by claiming shared values with their 1% oligarchs, while using the dollar’s exorbitant privilege, to steal cheap minerals, oil, gas, labor and land.

We’ve done this many times to countries like Iran, Mexico, East Asian nations, since the end of WWI & II, now our oligarchs, in bed with Trump, are doing it to our own citizens; history shows this trend started with Nixon, continued with Clinton, Obama and now the Orange 🍊 Trusk$ is using the same playbook.

Nothing here is new, the difference is that it’s done in the open and the villainy is actually praised in the open too, instead of under the cover of wicked neo-liberal economic narrative.

Chomsky et. al. has been pointing this out since the 60s, and now Chris Hedges is taking up the line of argument and helping to speak truth to power.

## The “Growth” game is over

We need a new narrative, new value based system overhaul, and we must tare down the mutated corrupt financial cancer inside our republic, for a new democratic narrative, with degrowth as core to the economic story, instead of capitalism, which wrecks infinite destruction on the planet; the trajectory of the “Abundance” narrative and its infinite growth & innovation is pure self destruction and madness.

The joining of power between government and capitalism is truly morally corrupt, and unjust broken formula.

It’s important to realize that Democracy and Capitalism do not mix, in fact they’re opposite forces with opposing values. A simple table showing these opposing and different values:

##### Political > Economic Powers = Values

- Oligarchy > Capitalism = Winner Takes All value
- Democracy > Socialism = Conservation of Resources for All values

It’s about degrowth and unalienable rights to economic development for all and not the unleashing of corporations monopolistic capitalism, with a small state.

Big socialist government and systems of values is democracy and economic justice for all.
