# The Problem with Growth

It’s important to define our problem clearly, and attack it at its core, to expose its weaknesses. 

It’s literally the 3rd World Playbook, that we’ve been using against everyone else, by claiming shared values with their 1% oligarchs, when in fact it’s just a wicked scheme to steal cheap minerals, oil, gas, labor and land.  

We’ve been doing this to Iran, Africa, Mexico, East Asia since the end of WWI & II, now we’re letting our oligarchs (at home) do it to our own citizens, history shows this trend since Nixon, to Clinton+Obama and now Orange 🍊 Trusk$! 

Nothing here is new, the difference is that it’s finally done in the open and The Villainy is actually praised in the open, instead of its Wicked  Liberal Hero narrative nonsense!  

Chomsky et. al have been pointing at all this since the 60s….now Chris Hedges is taking up that flag.  


## The “growth” game is over! 


We need a new narrative, new value based system overhaul, and we must tare down the mutated corrupt financial cancer inside our republic, for a new democratic narrative, with degrowth at its core economic story, instead of capitalism which wrecks infinite destruction on the Planet; infinite growth & innovation is madness! 

It’s the joining of the powers between Government & Capitalism that is truly morally corrupt, unjust and broken! 

A simple table showing the different values:

It’s important to realize that Democracy & Capitalism do not mix, they’re opposite forces with opposing values: 



### Political > Economic Powers  = Values 
___________________________ 

1. Oligarchy > Capitalism = Winner Takes All value 

2. Democracy > Socialism = Conservation of Resources for All values 

It’s about degrowth and unalienable rights to economic development for ALL and NOT the unleashing of Corporations Monopolistic Capitalism, with small states!! 

Big Socialist Government & Systems of Value == Democracy & economic justice for all.
