# What is hREA?

hREA (Holochain Resource-Event-Agent ) is an implementation of the Valueflows specification that enables a transparent and trusted account of resource and information flows between decentralized and independent agents, across and within ecosystems.

It’s built on three core concepts from REA accounting theory:

**Resources** - Economic resources would typically be useful goods and services, but could also be money, credits, energy, knowledge, designs, skills, CO2, methane, air, water, or almost anything else that some Agents can agree should be accounted for in their economic networks. 

**Events** - Economic Events affecting Economic Resources. An Economic Event can take actions like produce, modify, consume, or use Economic Resources, or transfer them from one Agent to another, or transport them from one location to another. 

**Agents** - Agents are individual persons or organizations or ecological agents, who perform Economic Events affecting Economic Resources. 

## How it Identifies Community Needs

hREA doesn’t automatically “identify” needs in the traditional AI sense. Instead, it creates a framework where community needs emerge through:

1. **Transparent Resource Tracking**: hREA, and ValueFlows, are fundamentally a system for capturing structured information, particularly about real world economic events (think transfers, production, etc.) and relationships. It is about allowing a community, business, or network to see all the ways in which it is connected to itself and the larger world. 
1. **Value Flow Mapping**: Value means useful economic resources. Flows means how people create, combine, move, and exchange them. Networks of value flows are created when processes and transfers are linked together through flows of resources. 
1. **Multi-perspective Accounting**: Instead of only the basic kind of financial accounting we’re used to, from hREA data you can produce those reports from the viewpoint of any agent in the network, do tracking and tracing through a supply chain, and more. 

## How it Distributes Resources

hREA handles distribution through several mechanisms:

1. **Process-Based Flows**: Input-Process-Output resource chains, where one Economic Resource is the output of one Process and then becomes an input to another, thus connecting the processes into a flow. 
1. **Agent-to-Agent Transfers**: Some flows do not involve processing, i.e. there is no transformation or transportation of Economic Resources. These flows simply transfer Economic Resources between Agents. 
1. **Coordination Networks**: The Agents involved in each Process in the chain need to coordinate with the previous and next Processes about the quantity, quality, and timing of resource flows between them. 

## Real-World Applications

hREA is being used in various contexts like mutual aid networks, open value networks, DAOs , and projects like LearnDeep, initially created by students at MSOE, supports a network of high school fablabs in Milwaukee that receive contributions of materials from the community and share these with each other. 

The key insight is that hREA doesn’t centrally decide what communities need or how to distribute resources. Instead, it provides a transparent, decentralized infrastructure where communities can track their own resources, coordinate their economic activities, and make informed decisions based on complete visibility into their resource flows and relationships.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of how this works in more detail?
